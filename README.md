Here you will find the lastest released version of the game engine.

# What is this game engine ?

I developped this game engine as a side project for some Java mini game assignements at university.
This game engine is heavily inspired from the Unity game engine (From Unity Technologies).
It looks a lot like Unity and try to stay as close as possible to Unity's API, but it doesn't come even close to it's functionnalities, performances or platform compatibility.

# Who can use it ?

Anyone who wants a Java "clone" of Unity can download it and use it.
It's functionning is almost similar to Unity: Put all your code, textures, sounds, etc in an Asset folder next to the engine package and everything works almost out of the box.
